Ultimate FAQ is built on a series of templates, such that everything that displays on the front end of the plugin can be customized by creating your own template files (to modify and/or overwrite the existing templates files). This gives you a powerful and non-destructive way to custmoize the look and functionality of the FAQs to your exact needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode to display FAQs? =

Yes, you can use the `[ultimate-faqs]` shortcode. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/ultimate-faqs-shortcode).

= Is there a Gutenberg block to display FAQs? =

Yes, you can search for the **Display FAQs** block. Alternatively, you'll find it in its own block category/section called **Ultimate FAQs**. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/display-faqs-block).

= What are all the available blocks and shortcodes? =

For a complete list of blocks and shortcodes, and their associated parameters/attributes, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/).

= Can I have multiple FAQ pages with different FAQs on each =

Yes. For this, we would recommend assigning your FAQs to different categories and then using the shortcode to include only the category you want on each page. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/ultimate-faqs-shortcode).

= How do I sort the order of my FAQs? =

The FAQs can be sorted by title, created date or modified date. The FAQ categories can be sorted by name, slug or count. If you are using the premium version, there is also a drag-and-drop table that can be used for precise ordering. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/faqs/order).

= Can I translate my FAQs? =

Yes, the plugin uses a custom post type and all the strings/labels are localized in the code. For more information on plugin translation, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/labelling/translating).

= Is this compatible with WPML? =

Yes, the plugin uses a custom post type and taxonomies. As such, if you enable our post type in the WPML settings, you'll be able to create translations of your FAQs, categories and tags. As well, all the strings/labels are localized in the code. As such, they will be picked up by WPML's String Translation tool for easy direct translating. 

For more info on translating the plugin, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/labelling/translating).

= The individual FAQ page isn't displaying correctly =

For the FAQ single post pages, it would be your theme that controls the look and layout. Because the FAQs are a custom post type, the single post page for FAQ posts would, by default, make use of your theme's single.php template file. If you'd like to modify the single post page for FAQs, we'd suggest duplicating your single.php file and creating one specifically for our post type, as discussed [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Type_Templates). Our post type is called **ufaq**, so you'd want to call your template file **single-ufaq.php**.

= Can I hide my FAQ categories? =

Yes, you can choose to display or hide FAQ categories on the FAQ settings page.

= How can I make my FAQs sharable over social media? =

On the FAQ premium settings page you can choose to link to twitter, facebook and more!

= How do I make my FAQs searchable? =

You can use the premium shortcode, [ultimate-faq-search], which displays an AJAX FAQ search form. You can use the "Auto-Complete Titles" option to have a list of all matching FAQ questions pop up when a user has typed 3 or more characters.

= Can I display all FAQs on pageload using the [ultimate-faq-search] shortcode? =

You can add the attribute "show_on_load" to the shortcode, and set it to "Yes" to display all FAQs when the page first loads.

= How do I add FAQs to a WooCommerce product page with the premium version? =

You can add FAQs for either a specific product or for a WooCommerce category.

For a specific product, create an FAQ category with the same name as the product, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

For a category of WooCommerce products, create an FAQ category with the same name as the WooCommerce category, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

= How do I customize my FAQs, for example, to change the font? =

You can customize the plugin by adding code to the Custom CSS box on the FAQ settings page, go to the "Custom CSS" box. For example to change the font you might want to add something like:

.ufaq-faq-title h4, .ufaq-faq-category-title h4  {font-family:"Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif;}

You can also use the "Styling" area of the "Options" tab if you're using the premium version, which has a built-in color picker for FAQ color fields and more!

= What is enabled in the premium version? =
