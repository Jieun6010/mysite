Display a YouTube player (with an optional playlist) on any post or page using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

Display a YouTube player (with an optional playlist) on any post or page using a simple shortcode. The plugin supports a static YouTube player (no video title) and a dynamic one (video title) using the YouTube Data API v3.

Embedded players must have a viewport that is at least 200px by 200px. If the player displays controls, it must be large enough to fully display the controls without shrinking the viewport below the minimum size. We recommend 16:9 players be at least 480 pixels wide and 270 pixels tall.

The YouTube player is responsive and it will work on all themes and screen sizes!

* Uses a simple shortcode which can be used in posts, pages, custom post types, widgets, reusable blocks.
* Uses the default YouTube Embed Code (iframe) with optional privacy-enhanced mode.
* Uses correct aspect ratio for videos using a Fluid Video technology.
* Uses native HTML5 Lazy loading.
* Used modern code and is optimised for speed.
* 100% free with no ads inside.
